René is an ecotoxicologist and his research aims to advance our understanding of human-induced environmental change on ecological and evolutionary processes in wildlife. Specifically, René's research focuses on pollution-driven adaptation, or “evolutionary ecotoxicology”, which seeks to understand the role of adaptation in organisms that enable populations to thrive in anthropogenically-stressed ecosystems.
