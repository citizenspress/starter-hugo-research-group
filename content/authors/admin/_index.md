**The Rudman lab is recruiting graduate students (MSc. and PhD), postdocs, and technicians for 2022. Please contact Dr. Rudman to express interest and discuss possible positions.**

The Rudman lab at WSU-Vancouver uses experiments and genomic tools to answer questions about the ecological and evolutionary fates of populations inhabiting rapidly changing environments. Active research topics in the lab span a range of biological systems including *Drosophila*, freshwater algal blooms and fish and cover topics at the intersection of ecology, rapid evolution, and genomics.

Students and postdocs have substantial latitude to pursue projects within the realm of eco-evolutionary dynamics and the study of the process of rapid adaptation. Please see the publications and projects listed below for current areas of research.

# Dr. Seth Rudman

I started as an assistant professor in the School of Biological Sciences at Washington State University in Vancouver in August 2021. Previously, I was a Banting postdoctoral fellow in the lab of [Dr. John Fryxell](https://www.fryxell-lab.com/thefryxelllab) at the University of Guelph. I was also a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Pennsylvania with [Dr. Paul Schmidt](http://web.sas.upenn.edu/paul-schmidt-lab/) and I worked closely with Dr. Dmitri Petrov at Stanford University. I completed my PhD at the University of British Columbia with [Dr. Dolph Schluter in 2016](https://www.zoology.ubc.ca/~schluter/wordpress/).
