abstract: Abiotic factors can act as barriers to colonization and drive local adaptation.
  During colonization, organisms may cope with changes in abiotic factors using existing
  phenotypic plasticity, but the role of phenotypic plasticity in assisting or hindering
  the process of local adaptation remains unclear. To address these questions, we
  explore the role of winter conditions in driving divergence during freshwater colonization
  and the effects of plasticity on local adaptation in ancestral marine and derived
  freshwater ecotypes of threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus). We found
  that freshwater‐resident stickleback had greater tolerance of acute exposure to
  low temperatures than marine stickleback, but these differences were abolished after
  acclimation to simulated winter conditions (9L:15D photoperiod at 4 °C). Plasma
  chloride levels differed between the ecotypes, but showed a similar degree of plasticity
  between ecotypes. Gene expression of the epithelial calcium channel (ECaC) differed
  between ecotypes, with the freshwater ecotype demonstrating substantially greater
  expression than the marine ecotype, but there was no plasticity in this trait under
  these conditions in either ecotype. In contrast, growth (assessed as final mass)
  and the expression of an isoform of the electroneutral Na+/H+ exchanger (NHE3) exhibited
  substantial change with temperature in the marine ecotype that was not observed
  in the freshwater ecotype under the conditions tested here, which is consistent
  with evolution of these traits by a process such as genetic assimilation. These
  data demonstrate substantial divergence in many of these traits between freshwater
  and marine stickleback, but also illustrate the complexity of possible relationships
  between plasticity and local adaptation.
