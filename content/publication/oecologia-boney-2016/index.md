abstract: Understanding how trait diversification alters ecosystem processes is an
  important goal for ecological and evolutionary studies. Ecological stoichiometry
  provides a framework for predicting how traits affect ecosystem function. The growth
  rate hypothesis of ecological stoichiometry links growth and phosphorus (P) body
  composition in taxa where nucleic acids are a significant pool of body P. In vertebrates,
  however, most of the P is bound within bone, and organisms with boney structures
  can vary in terms of the relative contributions of bones to body composition. Threespine
  stickleback populations have substantial variation in boney armour plating. Shaped
  by natural selection, this variation provides a model system to study the links
  between evolution of bone content, elemental body composition, and P excretion.
  We measure carbon:nitrogen:P body composition from stickleback populations that
  vary in armour phenotype. We develop a mechanistic mass-balance model to explore
  factors affecting P excretion, and measure P excretion from two populations with
  contrasting armour phenotypes. Completely armoured morphs have higher body %P but
  excrete more P per unit body mass than other morphs. The model suggests that such
  differences are driven by phenotypic differences in P intake as well as body %P
  composition. Our results show that while investment in boney traits alters the elemental
  composition of vertebrate bodies, excretion rates depend on how acquisition and
  assimilation traits covary with boney trait investment. These results also provide
  a stoichiometric hypothesis to explain the repeated loss of boney armour in threespine
  sticklebacks upon colonizing freshwater ecosystems.
