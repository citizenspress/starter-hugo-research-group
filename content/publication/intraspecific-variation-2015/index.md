abstract: Over the past decade it has become clear that variation between individuals
  of the same species (called intraspecific variation) can have profound effects on
  ecological communities.  Variation between genotypes of the same species in key
  functional traits, like plant phenology or predator feeding morphology, can cascade
  to alter community structure and ecosystem functions. For this study we used a factorial
  experiment to assess how variation in two species within the same ecosystem, a primary
  producer and top predator, interact to shape the ecological community and ecosystem
  functions. We uncovered interactive effects, whereby the combinations of genotypes
  from these two species had notable effects on the the ecological community. The
  results from this paper highlight that the true importance of intraspecific variation
  in ecology may be underappreciated, as few studies have assessed the effects of
  this variation in multiple co-occurring species.
