abstract: The processes of local adaptation and ecological speciation are often strongly
  shaped by biotic interactions such as competition and predation. One of the strongest
  lines of evidence that biotic interactions drive evolution comes from repeated divergence
  of lineages in association with repeated changes in the community of interacting
  species. Yet, relatively little is known about the repeatability of changes in gut
  microbial communities and their role in adaptation and divergence of host populations
  in nature. Here we utilize three cases of rapid, parallel adaptation and speciation
  in freshwater threespine stickleback to test for parallel changes in associated
  gut microbiomes. We find that features of the gut microbial communities have shifted
  repeatedly in the same direction in association with parallel divergence and speciation
  of stickleback hosts. These results suggest that changes to gut microbiomes can
  occur rapidly and predictably in conjunction with host evolution, and that host-microbe
  interactions might play an important role in host adaptation and diversification.
