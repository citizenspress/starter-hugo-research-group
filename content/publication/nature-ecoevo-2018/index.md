abstract: Recognition that evolution operates on the same timescale as ecological
  processes has motivated growing interest in eco-evolutionary dynamics. Nonetheless,
  generating sufficient data to test predictions about eco-evolutionary dynamics has
  proved challenging, particularly in natural contexts. Here we argue that genomic
  data can be integrated into the study of eco-evolutionary dynamics in ways that
  deepen our understanding of the interplay between ecology and evolution. Specifically,
  we outline five major questions in the study of eco-evolutionary dynamics for which
  genomic data may provide answers. Although genomic data alone will not be sufficient
  to resolve these challenges, integrating genomic data can provide a more mechanistic
  understanding of the causes of phenotypic change, help elucidate the mechanisms
  driving eco-evolutionary dynamics, and lead to more accurate evolutionary predictions
  of eco-evolutionary dynamics in nature.
abstract_short: Evolution can occur quickly; sometimes quickly enough to cause changes
  in ecological communities. Yet, our understanding of how, when, and why rapid evolution
  shapes ecology is still very rudimentary. Genomic data has greatly advanced many
  areas of study in biology and in this paper we discuss ways to apply genomic data
  to enhance research on the interplay between rapid evolution and ecology. We focus
  on using genomics to detect selection, estimate heritabilities of key traits, uncover
  phenotypes that are rapidly evolving, and determine the predictability of some ecological
  dynamics. When combined with experimental and observational datasets we believe
  that genomics can provide additional insight into the study of rapid evolution and
  ecology.

Evolution can occur quickly; sometimes quickly enough to cause changes in ecological communities. Yet, our understanding of how, when, and why rapid evolution shapes ecology is still very rudimentary.

We focus on using genomics to detect selection, estimate heritabilities of key traits, uncover phenotypes that are rapidly evolving, and determine the predictability of some ecological dynamics. When combined with experimental and observational datasets we believe that genomics can provide additional insight into the study of rapid evolution and ecology.
