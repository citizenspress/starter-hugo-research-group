abstract: The processes of local adaptation and ecological speciation are often strongly
  shaped by biotic interactions such as competition and predation. One of the strongest
  lines of evidence that biotic interactions drive evolution comes from the repeated
  divergence of lineages in association with repeated changes in the community of
  interacting species. Yet relatively little is known about the repeatability of changes
  in gut microbial communities and their role in adaptation and divergence of host
  populations in nature. Here we use three cases of rapid, parallel adaptation and
  speciation in freshwater threespine stickleback to test for parallel changes in
  associated gut microbiomes. We find that features of the gut microbial communities
  have shifted repeatedly in the same direction in association with parallel divergence
  and speciation of stickleback hosts. These results suggest that changes to gut microbiomes
  can occur rapidly and predictably in conjunction with host evolution, and that hostâ€“microbe
  interactions might play an important role in host adaptation and diversification.
