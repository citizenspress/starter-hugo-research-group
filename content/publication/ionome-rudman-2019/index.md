abstract: Evidence that organisms evolve rapidly enough to alter ecological dynamics
  necessitates investigation of the reciprocal links between ecology and evolution.
  Data that link genotype to phenotype to ecology are needed to understand both the
  process and ecological consequences of rapid evolution. Here, we quantified the
  suite of elements in individuals (i.e., ionome) and differences in the fluxes of
  key nutrients across populations of threespine stickleback. We find that allelic
  variation associated with freshwater adaptation that controls bony plating is associated
  with changes in the ionome and nutrient recycling. More broadly, we find that adaptation
  of marine stickleback to freshwater conditions shifts the ionomes of natural populations
  and populations raised in common gardens. In both cases ionomic divergence between
  populations was primarily driven by differences in trace elements rather than elements
  typically associated with bone. These findings demonstrate the utility of ecological
  stoichiometry and the importance of ionome‐wide data in understanding eco‐evolutionary
  dynamics.

Data that link genotype to phenotype to ecology are needed to understand both the
process and ecological consequences of rapid evolution. In this paper we quantified
the suite of elements in individuals (i.e., ionome) and differences in the fluxes of 
key nutrients across populations of threespine stickleback. We find that allelic 
variation associated with freshwater adaptation that controls bony plating is
associated with changes in the ionome and nutrient recycling. More broadly, we find
that adaptation of marine stickleback to freshwater conditions shifts the ionomes of 
natural populations and populations raised in common gardens. In both cases ionomic
divergence between populations was primarily driven by differences in trace elements 
rather than elements typically associated with bone. These findings demonstrate the
utility of ecological stoichiometry and the importance of ionome‐wide data in
understanding eco‐evolutionary dynamics.
