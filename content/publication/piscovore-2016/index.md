abstract: 'The addition of predators can play a key role in structuring ecological
  communities through both consumptive and non-consumptive effects. Stocking of piscivorous
  fish in lakes and similar experimental introductions have provided fundamental evidence
  in support of trophic cascade theory. Yet, the impact of piscivore addition on cross
  ecosystem subsidies and meso-predator resource use has not been well studied. Here,
  we use a replicated pond experiment to document the trophic impacts of a piscivore,
  cutthroat trout Onchorhynchus clarkii, on aquatic communities already containing
  a meso-predatory fish (threespine stickleback Gasterosteus aculeatus) and neighbouring
  terrestrial ecosystems. We find that piscivore addition led to a trophic cascade
  that extended across an ecosystem boundary: trout addition increased the biomass
  and average size of insects emerging into the terrestrial system. Piscivores caused
  a diet shift in stickleback, a non-consumptive effect that was likely mainly responsible
  for the increase in emerging insect biomass. We additionally show that heterogeneity
  in the strength of the pelagic trophic cascade was more closely correlated with
  the magnitude of diet shift (reflecting a non-consumptive effect) than decreases
  in stickleback abundance (a consumptive effect). Taken together, our experiment
  demonstrates that the addition of a piscivore causes a trophic cascade that can
  extend beyond the aquatic system and suggests that non-consumptive effects may more
  strongly influence the strength of a trophic cascade than has been previously recognized.'
