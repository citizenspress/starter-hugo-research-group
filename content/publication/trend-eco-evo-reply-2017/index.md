abstract: We thank Faith et al. for their informative and thought-provoking reply
  to our recent article in TREE. We agree with several of their comments regarding
  the path forward for the study of evosystem services and especially contemporary
  evosystem services, the topic of our article. Evosystem services are ‘all the uses
  or services to humans that are produced from the evolutionary process’ including
  benefits stemming from past, current and future evolution. In our article, we defined
  ‘contemporary evosystem services’ as ‘the maintenance or increase of an ecosystem
  service resulting from evolution occurring quickly enough to alter ecological processes’.
  Here, we briefly discuss two areas where our opinions and working definitions differ
  from those of Faith et al.
