abstract: Colonisation can expose organisms to novel combinations of abiotic and biotic
  factors and drive adaptive divergence. Yet, studies investigating the interactive
  effects of multiple abiotic factors on the evolution of physiological traits remain
  rare. Here we examine the effects of low salinity, low temperature, and their interaction
  on the growth of three North American populations of threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus
  aculeatus). In north-temperate freshwater habitats, stickleback populations experience
  a combination of low salinity and low winter temperatures that are not experienced
  by the ancestral marine and anadromous populations. Here we show that both salinity
  and temperature, and their interaction, have stronger negative effects on marine
  and anadromous populations than a freshwater population. Freshwater stickleback
  showed only a ~20% reduction in specific growth rate when exposed to 4 °C, while
  marine and anadromous stickleback showed sharp declines (82% and 74% respectively)
  under these conditions. The modest decreases in growth in freshwater stickleback
  in fresh water in the cold strongly suggest that this population has the capacity
  for physiological compensation to offset the negative thermodynamic effects of low
  temperature on growth. These results are suggestive of adaptive evolution in response
  to the interactive effects of low salinity and low temperature during freshwater
  colonisation.
