abstract: A ‘genes‐to‐ecosystems’ approach has been proposed as a novel avenue for
  integrating the consequences of intraspecific genetic variation with the underlying
  genetic architecture of a species to shed light on the relationships among hierarchies
  of ecological organization (genes → individuals → communities → ecosystems). However,
  attempts to identify genes with major effect on the structure of communities and/or
  ecosystem processes have been limited and a comprehensive test of this approach
  has yet to emerge. Here, we present an interdisciplinary field study that integrated
  a common garden containing different genotypes of a dominant, riparian tree, Populus
  trichocarpa, and aquatic mesocosms to determine how intraspecific variation in leaf
  litter alters both terrestrial and aquatic communities and ecosystem functioning.
  Moreover, we incorporate data from extensive trait screening and genome‐wide association
  studies estimating the heritability and genes associated with litter characteristics.
  We found that tree genotypes varied considerably in the quality and production of
  leaf litter, which contributed to variation in phytoplankton abundances, as well
  as nutrient dynamics and light availability in aquatic mesocosms. These ‘after‐life’
  effects of litter from different genotypes were comparable to the responses of terrestrial
  communities associated with the living foliage. We found that multiple litter traits
  corresponding with aquatic community and ecosystem responses differed in their heritability.
  Moreover, the underlying genetic architecture of these traits was complex, and many
  genes contributed only a small proportion to phenotypic variation. Our results provide
  further evidence that genetic variation is a key component of aquatic–terrestrial
  linkages, but challenge the ability to predict community or ecosystem responses
  based on the actions of one or a few genes.
abstract_short: Genetic data has become crucial to many areas of ecology, but whole
  genome data has not proven particularly beneficial. In this study we used an experiment
  to determine whether we could track the influence of individual alleles on metrics
  of community and ecosystem ecology in an outdoor aquatic experiment.  Previous work
  has demonstrated that allelic variation at loci that control mendelian phenotypes
  of keystone species can have incredibly strong effects on the wider community. In
  our experiment we used naturally occurring genotypes of a dominant tree species
  that had tremendous genetic variation for many ecologically important traits (phenology,
  leaf chemistry, productivity). Yet this genetic variation was underlied by many
  independent loci.  In our experiment we observed tremendously strong and pervasive
  effects of intraspecific diversity on ecological parameters. However, these effects
  were underlied by a variation in several traits and the variation in these traits
  was controlled by numerous genes. As such, the influence of any individual locus
  on any ecological response variable was miniscule. Our study modulates the expectations
  of these ‘genes-to-ecosystems’ approaches and suggests that other uses for genomic
  data in ecology may be more fruitful.

A tremendous body of research has demonstrated that when species are lost the function of ecosystems is altered. All of these studies model the process of extinction by demographic decline, where species decline until they are extirpated. The ecological effects of extinction by reverse speciation, where previously separate species interbreed leading to a single hybrid population, were largely unknown.  Using a case of reverse speciation in threespine stickleback in a replicated experiment and field study we demonstrated that this type of extinction can have profound effects on aquatic ecosystems-altering the benthic invertebrate community, the breakdown of organic matter, and the emergence of insects from the aquatic environment into the terrestrial.  These ecological effects were largely predictable based on the morphological evolution that had resulted from reverse speciation.  As such, our study provides a guideline for predicting how reverse speciation may effect ecology in many ecosystems.
