abstract: Young species are highly prone to extinction via increased gene flow after
  human-caused environmental changes. This mechanism of biodiversity loss, often termed
  reverse speciation or introgressive extinction, is of exceptional interest because
  the parent species are typically highly differentiated ecologically. Reverse speciation
  events are potentially powerful case studies for the role of evolution in driving
  ecological changes, as the phenotypic shifts associated with introgressive extinction
  can be large and they occur over particularly short timescales. Furthermore, reverse
  speciation can lead to novel phenotypes, which may in turn produce novel ecological
  effects. Here we investigate the ecological shift associated with reverse speciation
  in threespine stickleback fish using a field study and a replicated experiment.
  We find that an instance of introgressive extinction had cascading ecological consequences
  that altered the abundance of both aquatic prey and the pupating aquatic insects
  that emerged into the terrestrial ecosystem. The community and ecosystem impacts
  of reverse speciation were novel, and yet they were also predictable based on ecological
  and morphological considerations. The study suggests that knowledge about the community
  ecology and changes in functional morphology of a dominant species may lead to some
  predictive power for the ecological effects of evolutionary change. Moreover, the
  rapid nature and resultant ecological impacts associated with reverse speciation
  demonstrates the interplay between biodiversity, evolutionary change, and ecosystem
  function.
abstract_short: 'A tremendous body of research has demonstrated that when species
  are lost the function of ecosystems is altered. All of these studies model the process
  of extinction by demographic decline, where species decline until they are extirpated.
  The ecological effects of extinction by reverse speciation, where previously separate
  species interbreed leading to a single hybrid population, were largely unknown.  Using
  a case of reverse speciation in threespine stickleback in a replicated experiment
  and field study we demonstrated that this type of extinction can have profound effects
  on aquatic ecosystems-altering the benthic invertebrate community, the breakdown
  of organic matter, and the emergence of insects from the aquatic environment into
  the terrestrial.  These ecological effects were largely predictable based on the
  morphological evolution that had resulted from reverse speciation.  As such, our
  study provides a guideline for predicting how reverse speciation may effect ecology
  in many ecosystems. '

A tremendous body of research has demonstrated that when species are lost the function of ecosystems is altered. All of these studies model the process of extinction by demographic decline, where species decline until they are extirpated. The ecological effects of extinction by reverse speciation, where previously separate species interbreed leading to a single hybrid population, were largely unknown.  Using a case of reverse speciation in threespine stickleback in a replicated experiment and field study we demonstrated that this type of extinction can have profound effects on aquatic ecosystems-altering the benthic invertebrate community, the breakdown of organic matter, and the emergence of insects from the aquatic environment into the terrestrial.  These ecological effects were largely predictable based on the morphological evolution that had resulted from reverse speciation.  As such, our study provides a guideline for predicting how reverse speciation may effect ecology in many ecosystems.
