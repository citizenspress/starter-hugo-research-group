abstract: Animal pigmentation plays a key role in many biological interactions, including
  courtship and predator avoidance. Sympatric benthic and limnetic ecotypes of threespine
  stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) exhibit divergent pigment patterns. To test
  whether differential predation by cutthroat trout contributes to the differences
  in pigmentation seen between the ecotypes, we used a within‐generation selection
  experiment on F2 benthic–limnetic hybrids. After 10 months of differential selection,
  we compared the pigmentation of fish under trout predation to control fish not exposed
  to trout predation. We found that stickleback exhibited more lateral barring in
  ponds with trout predation. Ponds with trout were also less turbid, and a greater
  degree of barring was negatively correlated with the magnitude of turbidity across
  pond replicates. A more benthic diet, a proxy for habitat use, was also correlated
  with greater lateral barring and green dorsal pigmentation. These patterns suggest
  that differential exposure to cutthroat trout predation may explain the divergence
  in body pigmentation between benthic and limnetic ecotypes.
