summary: A part of my research in this area has focused on understanding population
  level-variation in fish physiology. Understanding the extent and pace over which
  Intraspecific variation in physiology evolves is crucial to being able to predict
  the pace of evolution and population persistence in the populations that are often
  isolated. An extension of my interest in this area is in quantifying the contribution
  of rapid evolution to ecosystem services in freshwater ecosystems. From local adaptation
  in salmonids to rapid evolution of *Daphnia* that leads to remediation of algal
  blooms there is a wealth of suggestive evidence of the benefits that we derive from
  rapid evolution. These 'evosystem services' present an avenue to manage ecosystems
  to ensure ecosystem services are maintained for future generations.
