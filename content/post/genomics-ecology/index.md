Some of the most pressing questions in biology are at the intersection of ecology, evolution, and genetics. To what extent will climate change and environmental degradation drive extinction? What role will rapid adaptation play and can this be enhanced?

Although my research in this area has largely outlined the considerable limitations of direct genes-to-ecosystem approaches, my ongoing research is revealing the tremendous utility of whole genome data when combined with data on phenotypes and population size. Ultimately, I believe that work in model systems will translate to leap forward in our understanding of population regulation and community ecology in nature.
